# NFT-Landing-Page
NFT landing page using HTML, CSS Grid

README – NFT Landing Page

About the Project
This project is a responsive NFT landing page created using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.
The goal was to closely match the given design while following the constraint of using only CSS Grid for layout (no Flexbox or frameworks).
 
My Approach
I started by breaking the design into clear sections such as the header, hero section, NFT cards, visual artwork, and footer.
All layouts were built using CSS Grid, and I used CSS variables to manage colors and support Dark/Light mode.
To make the page responsive, I relied on media queries, relative units, and clamp() instead of fixed sizes.
I also focused on keeping the code clean, readable, and structured so it’s easy to understand.
 
What I Struggled With
The most challenging part was the hero-art section.
Positioning the hand, stone, and barcode images together using only CSS Grid and absolute positioning—while keeping the layout responsive—took the most time.
It required a lot of trial and adjustment with positioning, z-index, and sizing to match the reference design.

Known Issues / Limitations
The navigation menu is hidden on smaller screens instead of using a mobile menu
The Dark/Light theme does not persist after refresh (no localStorage used)
The project focuses on frontend design and layout, not backend functionality

Bonus Features
Dark/Light mode toggle with smooth transitions
Keyboard-accessible theme toggle using native button behavior
Hover effects on cards and buttons

Technologies Used
